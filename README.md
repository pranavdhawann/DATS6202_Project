**Course:** DATS 6202: Machine Learning I  
**Contributors:** Pranav Dhawan, Akshit Reddy Palle, Aidan Carlisle

## Problem Statement

Modern enterprises face increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks that threaten data security and operational stability. This project tackles the problem of **network intrusion detection** using machine learning techniques to automatically classify network traffic as either **benign** or **malicious** (e.g., DDoS, malware, reconnaissance).

## Project Structure

- `EDA/`  
  - Contains exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualizations.

- `Models-and-Scripts/`  
  - Contains machine learning models and evaluation scripts.
